# Using the Array Map Method

## Learning Goals

* Practice Iteration

## Lab: Practice with Arrays

* Write a function `productSummaryAsAnArray()` which takes the array of products and returns an array of product summaries, i.e. `["Windows: 100$", "Doors, 200$", "Roofing: 400$"]`

* Write a function `productSummaryAsAnString()` which takes the array of products and returns an string of product summaries, i.e. `"Windows: 100$, Doors, 200$, Roofing: 400$"`

* Write a function `expensiveProducts()`, which takes the array of products and returns an array of products that cost more than `150`.

* Write a function `productEstimate(productName, productQuantity)` which takes a product name and product quantity as arguments, and returns the estimated total price of the product based on the products array.

* Write a function `totalProjectEstimate(numberOfWindows, numberOfDoors, numberOfRoofing)`, that calculate a total price of a project with the given quantities based on the products array.

## Extra Practice (optional)

* Write productSummaryAsAnArray() using `map`

* Write productSummaryAsAnString() using `map` and `.join`

* Write expensiveProducts() using `filter`

* Use `productEstimate()` to refactor `totalProjectEstimate()`
